Release Notes 1.0
 11/22/2017
 
 Welcome to Dan's Life!
 
 First coding excersize in decades so please be gentle.
 Mostly works.
 
 Known open issues
 
 - File LOAD works with .RLE files.  These are run length encoded files for 
   Conway's life.  For formate description, see: 
   http://www.conwaylife.com/w/index.php?title=Run_Length_Encoded
   I have only implemented the rule B3/S23.  All others behave strange.
 
 - File SAVE does not work.  It will create a test file.
 
 - You can paint one pixel at a time.  When I get a chance
   I will add a continous mouse down paint.
 
 - The RUN infinite loop is truly infinite.  It's a hack.
   The only way to break out of it is with a key press or mouse button.
   Open to suggestions for a more elegant implementation.
 
 - There is one HUGE optimization to make.  Currently I redraw each cell
   each refresh whether or not there has been a change.  Thats a lot of 
   reduntant little tiny rectangle calls.  It will eventually bother me enough
   to fix.  Seems plenty fast right now though.
 
 ENJOY!
     --- Dan
